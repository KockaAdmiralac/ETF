# Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous scripts I have created during studying.

## List
- `jesamseupisao.js`: Checks whether I have been enrolled in the next year
  through our student services.
- `budzet.js`: Used for generating a comparison of students' budget status
  throughout the years.
- `Mentor-report.md`: My report for the student mentor project on how the
  mentorship has gone
