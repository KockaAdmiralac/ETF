# [Concurrent and Distributed Programming](https://siwiki.rs/wiki/КДП)

This subject is about semaphores, regions, monitors, synchronization algorithms,
CSP, C-Linda... and really anything that has to do with the basics of concurrent
and distributed programming. We also implemented some of these in Java.
