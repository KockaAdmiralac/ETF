![GUI for the desktop application.](./Report/GUI.png?raw=true)

This project is about creating an [embedded program](./PIC) for the PIC
microcontroller which communicates with a [desktop application](./Desktop)
written in C# over UART about some voltage measurements. It also displays these
measurements on an LCD.

Full project specification is unfortunately not available publicly.
